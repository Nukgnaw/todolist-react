This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), the user guide of which you can find [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

It is a to-do list app done with React. Its JS code is transformed from [plain JS code](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_todo) along with slightly modified CSS style of the same source.
